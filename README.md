# Reading Lite

Reading.am is great - it's an easy way of sharing the things you are reading on the web.  But it's hard to get things back out of it in a nice way.  This is where Reading Lite comes in.  Run it on Heroku, and it'll serve your feed of read items with links that completely bypass Reading.am.

Don't want to run it yourself?  Just [use mine](https://reading-lite.herokuapp.com/alicefromonline) and change the username.
