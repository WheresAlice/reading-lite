# Reading Lite

Reading.am is great - it's an easy way of sharing the things you are reading on the web.  But it's hard to get things back out of it in a nice way.  This is where Reading Lite comes in.  Run it on Heroku, and it'll serve your feed of read items with links that completely bypass Reading.am.
